# Herbanium — working rules

Project instructions, loaded every session. These are rules, not suggestions.

## Testing is part of "done"

**Every new piece of functionality ships with a Playwright test in the same change.** Not a follow-up, not "later" — a feature without a test isn't finished.

- Pure logic (scheduling, scoring, geometry, data rules) → a node test in `tests/*.test.mjs`, registered in the `test` script in `package.json`.
- User-facing behaviour → an `e2e/*.spec.ts` spec.
- Both, when a feature has both. The node suite proves the rules; the E2E proves the user can actually reach them.

Aim for smoke-level coverage of the core path over exhaustive edge cases. A test that walks the real flow and asserts one meaningful thing beats five that assert implementation details.

## Before merging

Run **both** suites locally and report the actual pass/fail counts:

```
npm test                                    # node suite
npx playwright test --project=pixel-9 ...   # E2E (Chromium only locally)
```

Only Chromium browsers are installed locally — WebKit and Firefox run in CI, and they *do* find real differences (WebKit renders text ~35% taller in places; Firefox panes are shorter). Say so rather than implying full-matrix coverage.

Watch for a stale `vite preview` on `:5173`: `reuseExistingServer` is true locally, so a leftover server silently serves an old `dist/` and makes E2E results meaningless. Check with `ss -lntp | grep 5173` if results look impossible.

## Locators

Assert on stable hooks added to our own markup — `data-tour="..."` for tour anchors, `data-testid="..."` for test-only handles. No brittle absolute paths, no text matching where a hook would do. Add the hook at generation time rather than retrofitting it.

## Dev environment

- Vite dev server runs on **5174** (`npx vite --port 5174 --strictPort`). Never 5173 — Playwright's `webServer` owns that port.
- WSL2 doesn't deliver inotify events for `/mnt/c`, so `vite.config.js` polls for changes. Without that the dev server serves whatever it read at startup.

## Persisted state

`src/data/schemaVersion.js` holds `CURRENT_SCHEMA`. **Bumping it wipes every `herbanium.*` key on next load** — journals, saved blends, elementals. It's a reset switch, not a migration. The E2E specs import it rather than hardcoding a value; a stale literal there means the app wipes the seed and the tests quietly run against an empty profile.

## Architecture decisions — settled, don't re-litigate

- **No backend.** Catalogue and extraction profiles ship bundled. Read-mostly reference data; bundling avoids network dependency, latency and hosting cost.
- **Journaling is device-local, deliberately.** Single-purchase app, no subscription revenue, and mood data is sensitive.
- **The algorithm stays in-process.** One client, no other consumers, and extracting it would break offline use.
